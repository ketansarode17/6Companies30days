amount of gas>=amount of cost
If we the amount of gas is less than the total cost given then the answer will be -1;
As it is mentioned that the solution is unique and its guaranteed so
we will traverse the array and declare the curr_gas variable and add (gas[i]-cost[i])
if it becomes negative then we simply increment start to i+1 as we cannot start from previous position.

class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        int cst=accumulate(cost.begin(),cost.end(),0);
        int gs=accumulate(gas.begin(),gas.end(),0);
        if(gs<cst)return -1;
        int start=0,curr_gas=0;
        for(int i=0;i<gas.size();i++)
        {
            curr_gas+=gas[i]-cost[i];
            if(curr_gas<0)
            {
                curr_gas=0;start=i+1;
            }
        }
        return start;
    }
};
